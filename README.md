- Hi, Iâ€™m @BambooPyanda
- I'm a developer and I can code in Python, Java and Go
- I'm currently working on a game written in Java with no engine or frameworks (everything is written by me, completely from scratch), and it is stored in a private repo!
- Also, I'm working on building a 6502-based computer, similar to ones you'd find in the 80's.
